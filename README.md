This is a ejs and express based server. It serves static content and also renders js.html pages using ejs and ejs-locals. Internationalization is supported through i18n-abide. Ejs includes and layouts are supported per examples.

Content is placed in a public directory. If the sampleEmailjs.json is copied to emailjs.json and real credentials added, a POST to /emailjs will result in a contact email being sent.
